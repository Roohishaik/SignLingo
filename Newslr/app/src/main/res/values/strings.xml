    <string name="about_sign1">Sign language, a form of communication using bodily movements, particularly hands and arms, is employed when verbal interaction is not feasible. Its origins likely predate spoken language, with expressions ranging from simple gestures to complex combinations of manual signs, facial cues, and even finger-spelled words. It serves as a bridge in situations where vocal communication is hindered, such as between speakers of different languages or when one party is deaf.</string>
    <string name="about_sign2"><b>1. Sign language a natural and visual form of communication, conveys meaning through gestures and expressions facilitating interaction between individuals.</b> Sign language is a non-verbal language that Deaf persons exclusively count on to connect with their social environment. It is based on visual cues through the hands, eyes, face, mouth, and body. \n\n<b>2. No person or committee invented sign language.</b> No one knows for sure when the first Deaf person tried out visual gestures to express themselves. Many sources agree that using hand gestures and body language is one of the oldest and most basic forms of human communication, and it has been around just as long as spoken language. \n\n<b>3. Different countries have different sign languages.</b> There are several thousand spoken languages across the world and all are different from each other in one sense or the other. In the same way, sign language has hand gestures and visual representations of many different types.\n\n <b>4. Sign language is different from spoken language.</b> Every language, whether verbal or non-verbal, has their own elements and functions and differ from each other in how they are used. \n\n<b>5. Sign languages have their own grammar.</b> It is said that sign languages are the manual representation of spoken languages, but that’s not true. In reality, both language modes have their own grammar structure, vocabulary, and syntax. The grammars of these visual and gesture-based sign languages are unlike the grammars of sound-based or written languages. \n\n<b>6. Children learn sign languages the same way they learn spoken languages.</b> Parents are usually the power source of a child’s early language learning. Children learn how to do signs from a young age and as natural as they do with any spoken languages. There are also important sign language stages and baby babble. When babies are learning the visual language, they babble with their hands and over time, learn how to better express their signs. \n\n<b>7. Sign language is a visual language.</b> We all already know this fact, but it’s important to emphasise. Sign language may be like any other language in many ways and should be valued as such, but it’s also different.</string>
